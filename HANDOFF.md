## Read this first

This repository contains everything built during the June 19–21, 2026 hackathon weekend. The evaluation pipeline has been run end-to-end. A full research report draft exists. **The only blocking work before submission is human judge validation, PDF formatting, and form submission.**

## 30-second project summary

**Problem:** LLM safety is tested mostly in English. Indian users prompt in Hinglish, Romanized Hindi, and Marathi-English mix — and India-specific harms (caste, election misinfo) may behave differently across language registers.

**What we built:** IndicMixSafe — 24 harm scenarios × 4 language variants × 3 OpenAI models = 288 evaluated completions, with ASR and safety-drift metrics.

**Headline results (post-audit, June 19 honesty pass):**
- 0% attack success on English prompts (holds under all labels)
- 6.2% automated-judge ASR mean across registers (8.3% Indic, 0% English) → **1.7% after author audit** (judge over-counts ~3.75×; 4/15 COMPLY confirmed)
- Confirmed cross-register bypass = **electoral misinformation only**: EN refuses fake "polling booth moved" voter-suppression notices, Marathi MONO/CS/ROM comply (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1-mini)
- 18.3% register inconsistency; 3.3% hard drift
- Caste 33.3% (judge) **downgraded to ~0% on audit** — caveated explanations + sanitized rejection emails, not real bypass
- **Second contribution: LLM-as-judge over-counts ASR on Indic prompts** (methodology finding)

**Stack:** Python, OpenAI API, CSV checkpointing. No Promptfoo. Adaption credits not used.

## One-line pitch for judges

> English-only red-teaming reports 0% attack success, but GPT-4o and GPT-4.1-mini refuse fabricated "your polling booth has moved" voter-suppression notices in English while producing them in Marathi (formal, code-switched, and Romanized) — a confirmed cross-register failure English evaluation misses entirely. Along the way we find the automated LLM judge over-counts attack success ~3.75× on Indic prompts, so multilingual red-teaming needs human-in-the-loop review.
